Worked on an Indian Airlines Dataset (14 Feb, 2022 - 28 Feb, 2022) from Kaggle. Excel & Power BI were used for data cleaning & transforming. Worked with basic as well as advanced Power BI visuals in the project. Created & presented the project report at training centre (Codemate IT Services, Nagpur) on 27/07/2023. The project revolved around 6 major airline companies of India & their routes, number of flights, average duration, average ticket prices, count of flight classes with distribution among flight companies & the total revenue generation of each company. It was found that Indigo airlines generated the most revenue during that period (4 million rupees) with the most number of flights flown across the country (976 flights), followed by Vistara airlines with total collection of 2 million rupees & 799 total flights flown.
